# FILTERABLE CONTACT LIST WITH PHP,AJAX AND JSON

## Description
Fully responsive and mobile first asynchronous contact list where you can add,read,update and delete contacts from the contact list.
Since AJAX permits us to do requests to the server asynchronously(via XMLHTTP requests) while interacting with php, you do not need to reload the page after any action(CRUD). The contacts are stored in a JSON file where they are read and displayed on the web page.


## Installation
You need an Apache server (Ex: WAMP, XAMP,MAMP,...) to run and host the app.
Go on this site to install wamp.
```bash
www.wampserver.com
```
